# SmartMart

This Swift code includes the following:

- Enumerations (enums): In the code, there are three enums: "Day", "WeekDay", and "WeekendDay". Enums define a group of related values and enable you to work with those values in a type-safe way. In this case, the "Day" enum represents all seven days of the week, "WeekDay" represents weekdays (Monday to Friday), and "WeekendDay" represents weekends (Saturday and Sunday).
- Variables and Constants: Variables and constants store values that can be used later in the code. In this code, there are several variables, such as "today", "salaire", "age", and "nom". These variables are declared with optional types, meaning they can contain a value or be nil. Constants, like "codePersonnel" and "storeInventory", are also used in this code. Unlike variables, constants cannot be changed after being initialized.
- Optionals: Optionals allow a variable or constant to contain a value or be nil. In the code, there are several optional variables, like "salaire" and "age". To access the value of an optional, you need to unwrap it using the "if let" statement. If the optional contains a value, the "if let" statement will unwrap it, and you can use the value. If the optional is nil, the code inside the "else" statement will execute.
- Classes: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. In the code, there are two classes: "Book" and "SmartMart". The "Book" class represents a book object and has properties like "isbn", "title", "author", and "year". The "SmartMart" class represents a supermarket business management tool and has properties like "productName", "productCategory", "productBrand", "productPrice", "productCode", "productDistributor", and so on. The class also includes a generic class "Supply" that adds products to the inventory.
- Inheritance: Inheritance allows a subclass to inherit properties and methods from a superclass. In the code, the "Distributor" and "Stocks" classes inherit from the "SmartMart" class. The "Distributor" class has additional properties like "distributorName" and "distributorAddress", while the "Stocks" class has additional properties like "stockCategory" and "stockLocation".
- Functions: Functions perform a specific task and can be called multiple times. In the code, there are several functions, such as "getBookAuthor()", "hash()", "getBookAuthor()", and "min()". The "min()" function returns the minimum value of two numbers, and the "getBookAuthor()" function returns the name of the author of the book.
- Control flow statements: Control flow statements execute different code paths depending on the outcome of a comparison or a set of conditions. In the code, the "switch" statement executes different code blocks depending on the value of the "today" variable. The "if let" statement executes code if an optional variable has a value. The "for" loop iterates over the elements in a collection or a range of values.

Overall, the code demonstrates the use of several Swift programming concepts, such as enums, optionals, classes, inheritance, functions, and control flow statements, to create a supermarket business management tool.
